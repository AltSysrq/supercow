//! `Supercow` is `Cow` on steroids.
//!
//! `Supercow` provides a mechanism for making APIs that accept or return very
//! general references while maintaining very low overhead for usages not
//! involving heavy-weight references (e.g, `Arc`). Though nominally similar to
//! `Cow` in structure (and being named after it), `Supercow` does not require
//! the containee to be `Clone` or `ToOwned` unless operations inherently
//! depending on either are invoked.
//!
//! `Supercow` allows you to
//!
//! - Return values with ownership semantics decided at run-time;
//!
//! - Write APIs that allow client code to manage its resources however it
//! wants;
//!
//! - Perform efficient copy-on-write and data sharing;
//!
//! - Avoid cloning until absolutely necessary, even if the point at which it
//! becomes necessary is determined dynamically.
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! ## Simple Types
//!
//! In many cases, you can think of a `Supercow` as having only one lifetime
//! parameter and one type parameter, corresponding to the lifetime and type of
//! an immutable reference, i.e., `Supercow<'a, Type>` â‡’ `&'a Type`.
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate supercow;
//!
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use supercow::Supercow;
//!
//! // This takes a `Supercow`, so it can accept owned, borrowed, or shared
//! // values with the same API. The calls to it are annotated below.
//! //
//! // Normally a function like this would elide the lifetime and/or use an
//! // `Into` conversion, but here it is written out for clarity.
//! fn assert_is_forty_two<'a>(s: Supercow<'a, u32>) {
//!   // `Supercow` can be dereferenced just like a normal reference.
//!   assert_eq!(42, *s);
//! }
//!
//! # fn main() {
//! // Declare some data we want to reference.
//! let forty_two = 42u32;
//! // Make a Supercow referencing the above.
//! let mut a = Supercow::borrowed(&forty_two);
//! // It dereferences to the value of `forty_two`.
//! assert_is_forty_two(a.clone());             // borrowed
//! // And we can see that it actually still *points* to forty_two as well.
//! assert_eq!(&forty_two as *const u32, &*a as *const u32);
//!
//! // Clone `a` so that `b` also points to `forty_two`.
//! let mut b = a.clone();
//! assert_is_forty_two(b.clone());             // borrowed
//! assert_eq!(&forty_two as *const u32, &*b as *const u32);
//!
//! // `to_mut()` can be used to mutate `a` and `b` independently, taking
//! // ownership as needed.
//! *a.to_mut() += 2;
//! // Our immutable variable hasn't been changed...
//! assert_eq!(42, forty_two);
//! // ...but `a` now stores the new value...
//! assert_eq!(44, *a);
//! // ...and `b` still points to the unmodified variable.
//! assert_eq!(42, *b);
//! assert_eq!(&forty_two as *const u32, &*b as *const u32);
//!
//! // And now we modify `b` as well, which as before affects nothing else.
//! *b.to_mut() = 56;
//! assert_eq!(44, *a);
//! assert_eq!(56, *b);
//! assert_eq!(42, forty_two);
//!
//! // We can call `assert_is_forty_two` with an owned value as well.
//! assert_is_forty_two(Supercow::owned(42));   // owned
//!
//! // We can also use `Arc` transparently.
//! let mut c = Supercow::shared(Arc::new(42));
//! assert_is_forty_two(c.clone());             // shared
//! *c.to_mut() += 1;
//! assert_eq!(43, *c);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Owned/Borrowed Types
//!
//! `Supercow` can have different owned and borrowed types, for example
//! `String` and `str`. In this case, the two are separate type parameters,
//! with the owned one written first. (Both need to be listed explicitly since
//! `Supercow` does not require the contained value to be `ToOwned`.)
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate supercow;
//!
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use supercow::Supercow;
//!
//! # fn main() {
//! let hello: Supercow<String, str> = Supercow::borrowed("hello");
//! let mut hello_world = hello.clone();
//! hello_world.to_mut().push_str(" world");
//!
//! assert_eq!(hello, "hello");
//! assert_eq!(hello_world, "hello world");
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Accepting `Supercow` in an API
//!
//! If you want to make an API taking `Supercow` values, the recommended
//! approach is to accept anything that is `Into<Supercow<YourType>>`, which
//! allows bare owned types and references to owned values to be accepted as
//! well.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use supercow::Supercow;
//!
//! fn some_api_function<'a, T : Into<Supercow<'a,u32>>>
//!   (t: T) -> Supercow<'a,u32>
//! {
//!   let mut x = t.into();
//!   *x.to_mut() *= 2;
//!   x
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!   assert_eq!(42, *some_api_function(21));
//!   let twenty_one = 21;
//!   assert_eq!(42, *some_api_function(&twenty_one));
//!   assert_eq!(42, *some_api_function(Arc::new(21)));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Choosing the right variant
//!
//! `Supercow` is extremely flexible as to how it internally stores and manages
//! data. There are four variants provided by default: `Supercow`,
//! `NonSyncSupercow`, `InlineSupercow`, and `InlineNonSyncSupercow`. Here is a
//! quick reference on the trade-offs:
//!
//! | Variant           | Send+Sync?    | `Rc`? | Size  | Init  | Deref      |
//! |-------------------|---------------|-------|-------|-------|------------|
//! | (Default)         | Yes           | No    | Small | Slow  | Very Fast  |
//! | `NonSync`         | No            | Yes   | Small | Slow  | Very Fast  |
//! | `Inline`          | Yes           | No    | Big   | Fast  | Fast       |
//! | `InlineNonSync`   | No            | Yes   | Big   | Fast  | Fast       |
//!
//! "Init" above specifically refers to initialisation with an owned value or
//! shared reference. Supercows constructed with mundane references always
//! construct extremely quickly.
//!
//! The only difference between the `NonSync` variant and the default is that
//! the default is to require the shared pointer type (e.g., `Arc`) to be
//! `Send` and `Sync` (which thus prohibits using `Rc`), whereas `NonSync` does
//! not and so allows `Rc`. Note that a side-effect of the default `Send +
//! Sync` requirement is that the type of `BORROWED` also needs to be `Send`
//! and `Sync` when using `Arc` as the shared reference type; if it is not
//! `Send` and `Sync`, use `NonSyncSupercow` instead.
//!
//! By default, `Supercow` boxes any owned value or shared reference. This
//! makes the `Deref` implementation faster since it does not need to account
//! for internal pointers, but more importantly, means that the `Supercow` does
//! not need to reserve space for the owned and shared values, so the default
//! `Supercow` is only one pointer wider than a bare reference.
//!
//! The obvious problem with boxing values is that it makes construction of the
//! `Supercow` slower, as one must pay for an allocation. If you want to avoid
//! the allocation, you can use the `Inline` variants instead, which store the
//! values inline inside the `Supercow`. (Note that if you are looking to
//! eliminate allocation entirely, you will also need to tinker with the
//! `SHARED` type, which by default has its own `Box` as well.) Note that this
//! of course makes the `Supercow` much bigger; be particularly careful if you
//! create a hierarchy of things containing `InlineSupercow`s referencing each
//! other, as each would effectively have space for the entire tree above it
//! inline.
//!
//! The default to box values was chosen on the grounds that it is generally
//! easier to use, less likely to cause confusing problems, and in many cases
//! the allocation doesn't affect performance:
//!
//! - In either choice, creating a `Supercow` with a borrowed reference incurs
//! no allocation. The boxed option will actually be slightly faster since it
//! does not need to initialise as much memory and results in better locality
//! due to being smaller.
//!
//! - The value contained usually is reasonably expensive to construct anyway,
//! or else there would be less incentive to pass it around as a reference when
//! possible. In these cases, the extra allocation likely is a minor impact on
//! performance.
//!
//! - Overuse of boxed values results in a "uniform slowness" that can be
//! identified reasonably easily, and results in a linear performance
//! degradation relative to overuse. Overuse of `InlineSupercow`s at best
//! results in linear memory bloat, but if `InlineSupercow`s reference
//! structures containing other `InlineSupercow`s, the result can even be
//! exponential bloat to the structures. At best, this is a harder problem to
//! track down; at worst, it can result in entirely non-obvious stack
//! overflows.
//!
//! # Use Cases
//!
//! ## More flexible Copy-on-Write
//!
//! `std::borrow::Cow` only supports two modes of ownership: You either fully
//! own the value, or only borrow it. `Rc` and `Arc` have the `make_mut()`
//! method, which allows either total ownership or shared ownership. `Supercow`
//! supports all three: owned, shared, and borrowed.
//!
//! ## More flexible Copy-if-Needed
//!
//! A major use of `Cow` in `std` is found on functions like
//! `OsStr::to_string_lossy()`, which returns a borrowed view into itself if
//! possible, or an owned string if it needed to change something. If the
//! caller does not intend to do its own writing, this is more a "copy if
//! needed" structure, and the fact that it requires the contained value to be
//! `ToOwned` limits it to things that can be cloned.
//!
//! `Supercow` only requires `ToOwned` if the caller actually intends to invoke
//! functionality which requires cloning a borrowed value, so it can fit this
//! use-case even for non-cloneable types.
//!
//! ## Working around awkward lifetimes
//!
//! This is the original case for which `Supercow` was designed.
//!
//! Say you have an API with a sort of hierarchical structure of heavyweight
//! resources, for example handles to a local database and tables within it. A
//! natural representation may be to make the table handle hold a reference to
//! the database handle.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! struct Database;
//! impl Database {
//!   fn new() -> Self {
//!     // Computation...
//!     Database
//!   }
//!   fn close(self) -> bool {
//!     // E.g., it returns an error on failure or something
//!     true
//!   }
//! }
//! impl Drop for Database {
//!   fn drop(&mut self) {
//!     println!("Dropping database");
//!   }
//! }
//! struct Table<'a>(&'a Database);
//! impl<'a> Table<'a> {
//!   fn new(db: &'a Database) -> Self {
//!     // Computation...
//!     Table(db)
//!   }
//! }
//! impl<'a> Drop for Table<'a> {
//!   fn drop(&mut self) {
//!     println!("Dropping table");
//!     // Notify `self.db` about this
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! We can use this quite easily:
//!
//! ```
//! # struct Database;
//! # impl Database {
//! #   fn new() -> Self {
//! #     // Computation...
//! #     Database
//! #   }
//! #   fn close(self) -> bool {
//! #     // E.g., it returns an error on failure or something
//! #     true
//! #   }
//! # }
//! # impl Drop for Database {
//! #   fn drop(&mut self) {
//! #     println!("Dropping database");
//! #   }
//! # }
//! # struct Table<'a>(&'a Database);
//! # impl<'a> Table<'a> {
//! #   fn new(db: &'a Database) -> Self {
//! #     // Computation...
//! #     Table(db)
//! #   }
//! # }
//! # impl<'a> Drop for Table<'a> {
//! #   fn drop(&mut self) {
//! #     println!("Dropping table");
//! #     // Notify `self.db` about this
//! #   }
//! # }
//!
//! # #[allow(unused_variables)]
//! fn main() {
//!   let db = Database::new();
//!   {
//!     let table1 = Table::new(&db);
//!     let table2 = Table::new(&db);
//!     do_stuff(&table1);
//!     // Etc
//!   }
//!   assert!(db.close());
//! }
//!
//! # #[allow(unused_variables)]
//! fn do_stuff(table: &Table) {
//!   // Stuff
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! That is, until we want to hold the database and the tables in a struct.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! struct Resources {
//!   db: Database,
//!   table: Table<'uhhh>, // Uh, what is the lifetime here?
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! There are several options here:
//!
//! - Change the API to use `Arc`s or similar. This works, but adds overhead
//! for clients that don't need it, and additionally removes from everybody the
//! ability to statically know whether `db.close()` can be called.
//!
//! - Force clients to resort to unsafety, such as
//! [`OwningHandle`](http://kimundi.github.io/owning-ref-rs/owning_ref/struct.OwningHandle.html).
//! This sacrifices no performance and allows the stack-based client usage to
//! be able to call `db.close()` easily, but makes things much more difficult
//! for other clients.
//!
//! - Take a `Borrow` type parameter. This works and is zero-overhead, but
//! results in a proliferation of generics throughout the API and client code,
//! and becomes especially problematic when the hierarchy is multiple such
//! levels deep.
//!
//! - Use `Supercow` to get the best of both worlds.
//!
//! We can adapt and use the API like so:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! use supercow::Supercow;
//!
//! struct Database;
//! impl Database {
//!   fn new() -> Self {
//!     // Computation...
//!     Database
//!   }
//!   fn close(self) -> bool {
//!     // E.g., it returns an error on failure or something
//!     true
//!   }
//! }
//! impl Drop for Database {
//!   fn drop(&mut self) {
//!     println!("Dropping database");
//!   }
//! }
//! struct Table<'a>(Supercow<'a, Database>);
//! impl<'a> Table<'a> {
//!   fn new<T : Into<Supercow<'a, Database>>>(db: T) -> Self {
//!     // Computation...
//!     Table(db.into())
//!   }
//! }
//! impl<'a> Drop for Table<'a> {
//!   fn drop(&mut self) {
//!     println!("Dropping table");
//!     // Notify `self.db` about this
//!   }
//! }
//!
//! // The original stack-based code, unmodified
//!
//! # #[allow(unused_variables)]
//! fn on_stack() {
//!   let db = Database::new();
//!   {
//!     let table1 = Table::new(&db);
//!     let table2 = Table::new(&db);
//!     do_stuff(&table1);
//!     // Etc
//!   }
//!   assert!(db.close());
//! }
//!
//! // If we only wanted one Table and didn't care about ever getting the
//! // Database back, we don't even need a reference.
//! fn by_value() {
//!   let db = Database::new();
//!   let table = Table::new(db);
//!   do_stuff(&table);
//! }
//!
//! // And we can declare our holds-everything struct by using `Arc`s to deal
//! // with ownership.
//! struct Resources {
//!   db: Arc<Database>,
//!   table: Table<'static>,
//! }
//! impl Resources {
//!   fn new() -> Self {
//!     let db = Arc::new(Database::new());
//!     let table = Table::new(db.clone());
//!     Resources { db: db, table: table }
//!   }
//!
//!   fn close(self) -> bool {
//!     drop(self.table);
//!     Arc::try_unwrap(self.db).ok().unwrap().close()
//!   }
//! }
//!
//! fn with_struct() {
//!   let res = Resources::new();
//!   do_stuff(&res.table);
//!   assert!(res.close());
//! }
//!
//! # #[allow(unused_variables)]
//! fn do_stuff(table: &Table) {
//!   // Stuff
//! }
//!
//! ```
//!
//! # Conversions
//!
//! To facilitate client API designs, `Supercow` converts (via `From`/`Into`)
//! from a number of things. Unfortunately, due to trait coherence rules, this
//! does not yet apply in all cases where one might hope. The currently
//! available conversions are:
//!
//! - The `OWNED` type into an owned `Supercow`. This applies without
//! restriction.
//!
//! - A reference to the `OWNED` type. References to a different `BORROWED`
//! type are currently not convertible; `Supercow::borrowed()` will be needed
//! to construct the `Supercow` explicitly.
//!
//! - `Rc<OWNED>` and `Arc<OWNED>` for `Supercow`s where `OWNED` and `BORROWED`
//! are the exact same type, and where the `Rc` or `Arc` can be converted into
//! `SHARED` via `supercow::ext::SharedFrom`. If `OWNED` and `BORROWED` are
//! different types, `Supercow::shared()` will be needed to construct the
//! `Supercow` explicitly.
//!
//! # Advanced
//!
//! ## Variance
//!
//! `Supercow` is covariant on its lifetime and all its type parameters, except
//! for `SHARED` which is invariant. The default `SHARED` type for both
//! `Supercow` and `NonSyncSupercow` uses the `'static` lifetime, so simple
//! `Supercow`s are in general covariant.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//!
//! use supercow::Supercow;
//!
//! fn assert_covariance<'a, 'b: 'a>(
//!   imm: Supercow<'b, u32>,
//!   bor: &'b Supercow<'b, u32>)
//! {
//!   let _imm_a: Supercow<'a, u32> = imm;
//!   let _bor_aa: &'a Supercow<'a, u32> = bor;
//!   let _bor_ab: &'a Supercow<'b, u32> = bor;
//!   // Invalid, since the external `&'b` reference is declared to live longer
//!   // than the internal `&'a` reference.
//!   // let _bor_ba: &'b Supercow<'a, u32> = bor;
//! }
//!
//! # fn main() { }
//! ```
//!
//! ## `Sync` and `Send`
//!
//! A `Supercow` is `Sync` and `Send` iff the types it contains, including the
//! shared reference type, are.
//!
//! ```
//! use supercow::Supercow;
//!
//! fn assert_sync_and_send<T : Sync + Send>(_: T) { }
//! fn main() {
//!   let s: Supercow<u32> = Supercow::owned(42);
//!   assert_sync_and_send(s);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Shared Reference Type
//!
//! The third type parameter type to `Supercow` specifies the shared reference
//! type.
//!
//! The default is `Box<DefaultFeatures<'static>>`, which is a boxed trait
//! object describing the features a shared reference type must have while
//! allowing any such reference to be used without needing a generic type
//! argument.
//!
//! An alternate feature set can be found in `NonSyncFeatures`, which is also
//! usable through the `NonSyncSupercow` typedef (which also makes it
//! `'static`). You can create custom feature traits in this style with
//! `supercow_features!`.
//!
//! It is perfectly legal to use a non-`'static` shared reference type. In
//! fact, the original design for `Supercow<'a>` used `DefaultFeatures<'a>`.
//! However, a non-`'static` lifetime makes the system harder to use, and if
//! entangled with `'a` on `Supercow`, makes the structure lifetime-invariant,
//! which makes it much harder to treat as a reference.
//!
//! Boxing the shared reference and putting it behind a trait object both add
//! overhead, of course. If you wish, you can use a real reference type in the
//! third parameter as long as you are OK with losing the flexibility the
//! boxing would provide. For example,
//!
//! ```
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//!
//! use supercow::Supercow;
//!
//! # fn main() {
//! let x: Supercow<u32, u32, Rc<u32>> = Supercow::shared(Rc::new(42u32));
//! println!("{}", *x);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that you may need to provide an identity `supercow::ext::SharedFrom`
//! implementation if you have a custom reference type.
//!
//! ## Storage Type
//!
//! When in owned or shared mode, a `Supercow` needs someplace to store the
//! `OWNED` or `SHARED` value itself. This can be customised with the fourth
//! type parameter (`STORAGE`), and the `OwnedStorage` trait. Two strategies
//! are provided by this crate:
//!
//! - `BoxedStorage` puts everything behind `Box`es. This has the advantage
//! that the `Supercow` structure is only one pointer wider than a basic
//! reference, and results in a faster `Deref`. The obvious drawback is that
//! you pay for allocations on construction. This is the default with
//! `Supercow` and `NonSyncSupercow`.
//!
//! - `InlineStorage` uses an `enum` to store the values inline in the
//! `Supercow`, thus incurring no allocation, but making the `Supercow` itself
//! bigger. This is easily available via the `InlineSupercow` and
//! `InlineNonSyncSupercow` types.
//!
//! If you find some need, you can define custom storage types, though note
//! that the trait is quite unsafe and somewhat subtle.
//!
//! ## `PTR` type
//!
//! The `PTR` type is used to consolidate the implementations of `Supercow` and
//! `Phantomcow`; there is likely little, if any, use for ever using anything
//! other than `*const BORROWED` or `()` here.
//!
//! # Performance Considerations
//!
//! ## Construction Cost
//!
//! Since it inherently moves certain decisions about ownership from
//! compile-time to run-time, `Supercow` is obviously not as fast as using an
//! owned value directly or a reference directly.
//!
//! Constructing any kind of `Supercow` with a normal reference is very fast,
//! only requiring a bit of internal memory initialisation besides setting the
//! reference itself.
//!
//! The default `Supercow` type boxes the owned type and double-boxes the shared
//! type. This obviously dominates construction cost in those cases.
//!
//! `InlineSupercow` eliminates one box layer. This means that constructing an
//! owned instance is simply a move of the owned structure plus the common
//! reference initialisation. Shared values still by default require one boxing
//! level as well as virtual dispatch on certain operations; as described
//! above, this property too can be dealt with by using a custom `SHARED` type.
//!
//! ## Destruction Cost
//!
//! Destroying a `Supercow` is roughly the same proportional cost of creating
//! it.
//!
//! ## `Deref` Cost
//!
//! For the default `Supercow` type, the `Deref` is exactly equivalent to
//! dereferencing an `&&BORROWED`.
//!
//! For `InlineSupercow`, the implementation is a bit slower, comparable to
//! `std::borrow::Cow` but with fewer memory accesses..
//!
//! In all cases, the `Deref` implementation is not dependent on the ownership
//! mode of the `Supercow`, and so is not affected by the shared reference
//! type, most importantly, making no virtual function calls even under the
//! default boxed shared reference type. However, the way it works could
//! prevent LLVM optimisations from applying in particular circumstances.
//!
//! For those wanting specifics, the function
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Substitute Cow with InlineSupercow for the other case.
//! // This takes references so that the destructor code is not intermingled.
//! fn add_two(a: &Cow<u32>, b: &Cow<u32>) -> u32 {
//!   **a + **b
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! results in the following on AMD64 with Rust 1.13.0:
//!
//! ```text
//!  Cow                                Supercow
//!  cmp    DWORD PTR [rdi],0x1         mov    rcx,QWORD PTR [rdi]
//!  lea    rcx,[rdi+0x4]               xor    eax,eax

//!
//! If the default `Supercow` is used above instead of `InlineSupercow`, the
//! function actually compiles to the same thing as one taking two `&u32`
//! arguments. (This is partially due to optimisations eliminating one level of
//! indirection; if the optimiser did not do as much, it would be equivalent to
//! taking two `&&u32` arguments.)
//!
//! ## `to_mut` Cost
//!
//! Obtaining a `Ref` is substantially more expensive than `Deref`, as it must
//! inspect the ownership mode of the `Supercow` and possibly move it into the
//! owned mode. This will include a virtual call to the boxed shared reference
//! if in shared mode when using the default `Supercow` shared reference type.
//!
//! There is also cost in releasing the mutable reference, though
//! insubstantial in comparison.
//!
//! ## Memory Usage
//!
//! The default `Supercow` is only one pointer wider than a mundane reference
//! on Rust 1.13.0 and later. Earlier Rust versions have an extra word due to
//! the drop flag.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::mem::size_of;
//!
//! use supercow::Supercow;
//!
//! // Determine the size of the drop flag including alignment padding.
//! // On Rust 0.13.0+, `dflag` will be zero.
//! struct DropFlag(*const ());
//! impl Drop for DropFlag { fn drop(&mut self) { } }
//! let dflag = size_of::<DropFlag>() - size_of::<*const ()>();
//!
//! assert_eq!(size_of::<&'static u32>() + size_of::<*const ()>() + dflag,
//!            size_of::<Supercow<'static, u32>>());
//!
//! assert_eq!(size_of::<&'static str>() + size_of::<*const ()>() + dflag,
//!            size_of::<Supercow<'static, String, str>>());
//! ```
//!
//! Of course, you also pay for heap space in this case when using owned or
//! shared `Supercow`s.
//!
//! `InlineSupercow` can be quite large in comparison to a normal reference.
//! You need to be particularly careful that structures you reference don't
//! themselves contain `InlineSupercow`s or you can end up with
//! quadratically-sized or even exponentially-sized structures.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::mem;
//!
//! use supercow::InlineSupercow;
//!
//! // Define our structures
//! struct Big([u8;1024]);
//! struct A<'a>(InlineSupercow<'a, Big>);
//! struct B<'a>(InlineSupercow<'a, A<'a>>);
//! struct C<'a>(InlineSupercow<'a, B<'a>>);
//!
//! // Now say an API consumer, etc, decides to use references
//! let big = Big([0u8;1024]);
//! let a = A((&big).into());
//! let b = B((&a).into());
//! let c = C((&b).into());
//!
//! // Well, we've now allocated space for four `Big`s on the stack, despite
//! // only really needing one.
//! assert!(mem::size_of_val(&big) + mem::size_of_val(&a) +
//!         mem::size_of_val(&b) + mem::size_of_val(&c) >
//!         4 * mem::size_of::<Big>());
//! ```
//!
//! # Other Notes
//!
//! Using `Supercow` will not give your application `apt-get`-style Super Cow
//! Powers.

/// Defines a "feature set" for a custom `Supercow` type.
///
/// ## Syntax
///
/// ```
/// #[macro_use] extern crate supercow;
///
/// # pub trait SomeTrait { }
/// # pub trait AnotherTrait { }
///
/// supercow_features!(
///   /// Some documentation, etc, if desired.
///   pub trait FeatureName: SomeTrait, AnotherTrait);
/// supercow_features!(
///   pub trait FeatureName2: SomeTrait, Clone, AnotherTrait);
///
/// # fn main() { }
/// ```
///
/// ## Semantics
///
/// A public trait named `FeatureName` is defined which extends all the listed
/// traits, minus special cases below.
///
/// If `Clone` is listed, the trait gains a `clone_boxed()` method and
/// `Box<FeatureName>` is `Clone`.
///
/// If `TwoStepShared(SomeType)` is listed, the boxed type will implement
/// `TwoStepShared` for all `OWNED`/`BORROWED` pairs where
/// `SomeType<OWNED,BORROWED>` implements the feature a whole and
/// `OWNED: SafeBorrow<BORROWED>`.
///
/// All types which implement all the listed traits (including special cases)
/// implement `FeatureName`.

// Historical note: Originally, the shared type was required to implement
// `ConstDeref`, and so the shared type was `Box<$feature<Target = BORROWED>>`.
// This mostly worked, but it confused lifetime inference in a number of
// cases, particularly surrounding variance. Because of that, we instead have
// stricter requirements on a number of traits (including making `SharedFrom`
// unsafe) so that we can pull the pointer out of the non-boxed shared
// reference and hold onto it thereon out, thus obviating the need for `SHARED`
// to carry that part of the type information.

    // will change whenever this `Supercow` is relocated. To handle this, we

    // pointer, since no modern system ever has virtual memory mapped between 0
